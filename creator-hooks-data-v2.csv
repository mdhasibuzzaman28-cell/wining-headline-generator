"Clear Ketchup","(Counterintuitive or Impossible Thing)","+1238","“Clear Ketchup” was trending on TikTok, so that certainly helped this video do well.

It was my first time really trying to do title and thumbnail first, and in this case, getting clarity on the title/thumbnail combo really gave me a lot of clarity on the direction that the video needed to go.

"I spent a year searching for the weirdest music tech","I spent a year searching for the weirdest (Thing)","+601","Time Frame – Input Bias is a psychology term that means we value something more when somebody puts a lot of time into something, so the time frame of “a year” makes you feel like this video is going to be more valuable than just “I searched for the weirdest music tech.” Curiosity – Using words like “weird”, and making them extreme (the weirdest) are two ways to build curiosity."
"5 Signs He’s Emotionally COMMITTED To You","5 Signs (Deep Desire)","+1158","List – Lists make videos feel more tangible (you know exactly what the video will be about) and they add some curiosity.

"The NEW LOOK Golden State Warriors Are A PROBLEM","The NEW LOOK (Entity) (Exciting Description)","+619","Timeliness – People love news and new things. The Warriors got some new players this offseason and this video was published the day after their first preseason game, so it was everybody’s first chance to see the “NEW LOOK Golden State Warriors”. Negativity – The word “PROBLEM” is dramatic in a good way. Desire – Even though this title says the Warriors are a “PROBLEM”, it means they’re awesome, and since this channel is a channel about the Warriors, the audience loves it."
"Just Bury Bananas in the Garden and This Happens","Just (Simple Action) and This Happens","+705","Curiosity – The title and thumbnail both open a loop because they make you want to what will happen.

"Why you Must NOT Shoot Medics in War","Why you Must NOT (Seemingly Obvious Activity You Would Do)","+707","Curiosity – This is counterintuitive because you would assume you can shoot anybody in war. A simple way to build curiosity is to tell people what not to do, instead of telling them what to do."
"A 16-Year-Old Guitar Store Owner Sold Me An INCREDIBLE Guitar","A (Unexpected Person) (Action) Me An INCREDIBLE (Entity)","+364","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity two ways: 1) A “16-Year-Old Guitar Store Owner” is unexpected because that’s so young to be a store owner. 2) It opens a loop because you want to know what the guitar is.

Desire – This creator’s audience is interested in or wants to try Huberman’s morning routine. Refute Objection – A lot of people think, “I’d love to try Huberman’s morning routine, but it’s too hard.” But this creator saying she made it work for “An Average Person (myself)” gets rid of that excuse."
"Someone Called the GAME WARDEN Because I Was Catching Giant Fish!","Someone Called the (Authorities) Because I Was (Awesome Activity)!","+57894","Authority – Calling the game warden increases the magnitude of what’s going on here. Negativity – This title promises a lot of drama, which people love. Desire – This creator’s audience would love to catch such big fish that somebody calls the game warden on them.

"Once you visualize correctly, the shift happens IMMEDIATELY. (this is how.)","Once you [Activity] correctly, [End Goal] happens IMMEDIATELY. (this is how.)","+825","Curiosity – This title builds curiosity by using two open loops: 1) It doesn’t tell you how to achieve this shift, so you have to click and watch. 2) It also promises that you’ll achieve an amazing, but open-ended goal, so your mind starts to wander and imagine your own “shift”. (Using specific goals in titles also works very well, but this builds so much wonder, curiosity, and desire that the vagueness works well here. The buzzwords “visualize” and “the shift” also help.) Desire – This creator’s audience wants to learn how to visualize and shift their lives, and they would love to do it immediately (people love speed)."
"The FIRST Sign of a Magnesium Deficiency Is… (Dr. Berg Explains)","The FIRST Sign of [Problem] Is… ([Authority Figure] Explains)","+1453","Negativity – This leverages fear because the audience doesn’t want to be magnesium deficient.

"Can I 100% Every Mario Kart Game in 1 Week?","Can I (Achieve Goal) in 1 Week?","+691","Curiosity – This builds curiosity by asking a question. Time Frame – The time frame of “in 1 Week” makes this video more tangible and adds a constraint. Both of these make this video more interesting. “Every” – I’m surprised by how often I’ve seen the word “every” pop up in successful videos. I’m assuming it makes the video feel more epic because it adds scale. This isn’t just about a few Mario Kart games, it’s about every Mario Kart game. This same exact format actually got this creator another 2.4 million views a few months ago. The title was, “Can I 100% Every 3D Mario Game in 1 Week?” This is a good reminder to continue doing what works."
"How A Silent Album Robbed Spotify Of $20,000","How A (Counterintuitive Entity) (Negative Action)","+1269","Curiosity – A “Silent Album” is an oxymoron. This contrast and counterintuitiveness builds curiosity. Negativity – Robbing Spotify of $20,000 is full of drama and people love drama."

Negativity – There’s lots of drama and fear in this title, which grabs people’s attention and makes them want to click. Confirms Suspicions – There’s already a narrative that Facebook is evil, so when some people see this title they say, “I knew it!”. People love when their suspicions are confirmed. Broadly Appealing – I don’t think Frances Haugen’s name is that well-known (no offense, Frances), so giving her the label “Whistleblower” is an effective strategy. It attracts a broader audience because it’s more easily understood. Obviously they did drop her name at the end, but using her name at the end and the label before it was a good call. “Facebook is WORSE than You Think: Whistleblower Reveals All” is so much more powerful than saying “Facebook is WORSE than You Think: Frances Haugen Reveals All”, right?"

Negativity – “They’re full of lies” promises this video will have lots of drama, which people love."

"Struggles of African Immigrant Working in Canada","Struggles of (Specific Situation)","+39833","This video was a massive breakout from a new channel and I’m not *exactly* sure why it did so well, but I have a few theories: Negativity – People love negativity and drama. Talking about struggles and how a country isn’t worth it definitely fits that. Confirmation – A lot of people in the comments are essentially saying “Yes, I know! This has been my experience too.” When you confirm what lots of people are thinking, but may not be openly talked about, they’ll want to watch and comment. Specific Audience – When you go too specific on YouTube it’s easy to have too small of a potential audience. But people living in Canada, Africans, and immigrants seem to rally around this video saying this is what they’re feeling. If you (and the YouTube algorithm) can find a specific audience that has strong feelings about your content, you can win big."

"$ix Figures My First Year As A YouTuber? True Or False? You Decide…","(Goal) My First Year As A (Position)? True Or False?
